Project Overview

This project is a structured collection of both theoretical concepts and hands-on labs covering core areas of cybersecurity, networking, and system security. It is designed to bridge the gap between understanding security principles and applying them in real-world scenarios.

Theoretical Content:

ATT&CK.pdf (BTLO): Provides an overview of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, explaining attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used in threat detection and security analysis.

SOC 101 id 8, 27, 34, 59.pdf (Let’s Defend): Covers fundamental SOC concepts, including incident response workflows, monitoring techniques, and practical SOC-related exercises.

Practical Labs:

Tomcat Takeover Lab.pdf (CyberDefenders): Demonstrates how to identify, analyze, and exploit vulnerabilities within Apache Tomcat servers.

WebStrike Lab.pdf (CyberDefenders): Focuses on web application security by exploring common attack vectors and exploitation methods.

Wireshark 101.pdf (TryHackMe): Introduces network traffic analysis using Wireshark, emphasizing packet inspection, troubleshooting, and security monitoring.

Overall, this project combines theory with practice to help learners build a solid understanding of cybersecurity frameworks, threat analysis, and real-world attack techniques. It is well-suited for students, junior security analysts, and individuals seeking practical cybersecurity experience.
